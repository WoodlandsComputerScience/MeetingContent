			<h2><u>What is a Website?</u></h2>
			<article>
				<p>A website is what you are looking at right now! To create a website, we need to use <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. <strong>HTML</strong> <i>(Hyper Text Markup Language)</i> is used to describe the <strong>structure</strong> of a website. By using tags such as &lthead&gt, &ltbody&gt, &ltheader&gt, and &ltparagraph&gt, you can organize the inforation on your website! <strong>CSS</strong> <i>(Cascading Style Sheets)</i> lets you style your website, and change things such as background colour.</p>

					<h2><b><u>HTML</u></b></h2>
					<p>HTML is the foundation of every website. Without HTML, you wouldn't be able to display any elements at all.</p>
					<p>HTML was created in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee. Its invention allowed users of the Internet to navigate webpages using <em>hyperlinks</em>, which led users to other webpages. This interconnectedness was a new invention that was fundamental to the new web.</p>
					<p>HTML has come a long way since then, and many new concepts have been introduced in HTML 5. Examples include new semantic tags, which makes web pages more machine-readable, and new ways to handle graphical content, such as video and audio tags.</p>

					<h2><b><u>CSS</u></b></h2>
					<p>In 1996, CSS was introduced, revolutionizing webpages by seperating the content from the presentation.</p>
					<p>Before the creation of CSS, styling a website was very difficult. Each HTML element had to be styled seperately, wasting huge amounts of space. CSS was invented to solve this problem, using external stylesheets to act on a single document at once - "cascading".</p>
					<p>In a new age of computation, standards for styling have increased drastically. CSS 3 introduces many new tools to enhance the look of your webpages. Examples include rgba, new drop shadow tools, new border style properties, and many new selectors.</p>
